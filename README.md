# Weighted Beltbag


Mod that changes Beltbag to cause you to gain weight upon collecting items inside it and lose weight upon removing items. To build, in your nuget packages folder replace the dlls in the version 49 folder to the latest version, as I couldn't figure out dependencies when pulling in CSync.
